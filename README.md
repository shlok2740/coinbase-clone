A Coinbase clone (only send/receive crypto) using Next.js, ThirdWeb SDK, Sanity CMS, Styled Components and Vercel

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:


```bash
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
